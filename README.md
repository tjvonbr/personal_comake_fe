## Overview
Political engagement in the United States is an obviously complex phenomenon to study.  Because of our federalist structure, there are many levels of government that encourage our participation.  Some argue that our participation at the local level is more important and meaningful than at the state or national level while others argue the opposite.  In addition, there are many political 'acts' that might constitute political engagement.  For example, voting in an election would be considered a political act.  So would attending, and participating in, a poltical demonstation.  The Pew Research Center has conveniently polled Americans attempting to measure their levels of political engagement by asking if they've participated in any number of 11 acts (the study containing the list can be found [here](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2009/09/01/the-current-state-of-civic-engagement-in-america/)).
